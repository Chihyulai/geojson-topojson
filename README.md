# geojson-to-topojson

A simple (some would argue dumb) web interface to quickly convert GeoJSON to TopoJSON.

## Why

So folks can just google "convert geojson to topojson" and use this simple web interface to quickly convert some data without having to install anything. Perhaps as a first step to trying out TopoJSON.

Users looking to convert lots of data programmatically should use the [topojson](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson) library locally ([directions](http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/45138/convert-geojson-to-topojson)).
